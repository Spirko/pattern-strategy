Strategy Analysis for Simon Tatham's Pattern

The original game: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/pattern.html

This project will be an HTML/CSS/Javascript version of the game that can give strategy hints and analyze the relative benefits of the strategy options.  Originally I started this on CodePen.IO, but it's better suited to a multi-file implementation with version tracking.  The goal is for this to work via GitHub Pages.  The URL is:
